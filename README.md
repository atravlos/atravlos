# Data Science Portfolio - Anthony Travlos

## About Me ##

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Notre Dame (class of 2025) majoring in Biological Sciences and minoring in Data Science and Theology. I will be attending medical school at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine starting in the fall of 2025 and my work will seek to bridge the gap between data science, theology, and medicine. In my free time, I love exploring sports data particularly in the NFL and college football realms.
