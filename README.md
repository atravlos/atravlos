## Data Science Portfolio - Anthony Travlos

## About Me ##

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Notre Dame majoring in Biological Sciences and minoring in Data Science and Theology. I will be attending medical school starting next fall and my work seeks to bridge the gap between data science and medicine. In my free time, I love exploring sports data particularly in the NFL and college football realms.

## Projects ##

Check out my work throughout the semester in the Data-Science-Portfolio Repository or at the following links:

[**Basic Streamlit App**](https://github.com/atravlos/Travlos-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app#welcome-to-my-basic-streamlit-app)

This project uses streamlit to build a dashboard that allows users to filter and observe data from the "Palmer Penguins" dataset.

>**Skills and Libraries**
>>-Streamlit
>>-Pandas

[**Exploring Tidy Data Principles through 2008 Summer Olympic Medalists**](https://github.com/atravlos/Travlos-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project#exploring-the-2008-summer-olympics-medalists)

This project incorporates data wrangling and cleaning to transform a dataset to conform with Tidy Data Principles (Each variable is in its own column, each observation forms its own row, and each type of observational unit forms its own table). Additionally, this project performs exploratory data analysis through the evaluation of medal counts by gender and by event. Whereas the Basic Streamlit App allows a user to filter and observe data, this project guides a user through data wrangling and data visualization to answer a question and tell a story.

- **Tools:** MS Excel, Data Analysis, Logistic Regression, Data Visualization

## Goals ##

#### What I Hope to Learn This Semester

1. Expand python skills beyond pandas.
2. Learn to make informative, user-friendly dashboards.
3. Apply data science skills to a medicine/healthcare based project.
