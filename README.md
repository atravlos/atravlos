## Data Science Portfolio - Anthony Travlos

## About Me ##

I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Notre Dame majoring in Biological Sciences and minoring in Data Science and Theology. I will be attending medical school starting next fall and my work seeks to bridge the gap between data science and medicine. In my free time, I love exploring sports data particularly in the NFL and college football realms.
